After Loneese retires from her job as a secretary and her husband of forty years, Horace, retires from his job at the Pentagon, the couple move into Sunset Place, a retirement apartment complex. Both Horace and Loneese have had their fair share of affairs, but before they move, they promise each other they'll work harder for their marriage. That promise, though, is quickly broken, and Horace and Loneese become known at Sunset Place as the couple who hates each other. They keep separate phones and even separate refrigerators until Loneese gets sick and dies alone in a hospital room.
